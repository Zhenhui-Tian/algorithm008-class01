//You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each hous
//e has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from r
//obbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and i
//t will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into 
//on the same night. 
//
// Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of eac
//h house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alert
//ing the police. 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: [1,2,3,1]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
//             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4. 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
//Output: 12
//Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 
//(money = 1).
//             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
